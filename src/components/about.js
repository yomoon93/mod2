           Hey fellow user my name is Kevin Munar and welcome to ZillowMoon and i hope you enjoyed the <br/>
           experience on my mock website of zillow, just to give you a little info about myself. I went to school<br/>
           at city tech where i got my computer engineering degree. I fell in love with computer hardware and code while in school,<br/>
           where i created robots and created different things that I was doing school. This website was created with the idea of a<br/> 
           project that im trying to do for a future business.
